# Gen 349 - Week 14 - Programming for Biologists
# Instruction on how to access High Performance Computer (HPC) Class

All of the following instructions are applicable for first time users of Nova. If you have accessed Nova before (in another class or in your research lab), it will not be necessary.

## Installation of necessary software
### For Windows10/PC Users:
You need to install Putty. How to Install PuTTY:   
1. Go to this Website to download the latest version of Putty: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html   
2. There are two versions available for download:   
a. If you know for sure that your PC has a 64-bit processor, download 64-bit: putty-64bit-0.74-installer.msi   
b. If you aren’t sure about your computer’s processor, download 32-bit: putty-0.74-installer.msi   
3. Once you have downloaded PuTTY, double click on the downloaded files and follow the prompts to install.

### Installation of Google Authenticator (GA):
This application is necessary to log in to the class’ high performance computer. Install Google Authenticator (GA) app on your mobile device using the instructions found under your device type:
- Google Auth on Android https://www.hpc.iastate.edu/guides/nova/access-and-login/google-auth-on-android
- Google Auth on iPhone iPad iPod https://www.hpc.iastate.edu/guides/nova/access-and-login/google-auth-on-iphone-ipad-ipod
- Google Auth on Windows Desktop https://www.hpc.iastate.edu/guides/nova/access-and-login/google-auth-on-windows

### VPN (optional - for people who work on HPC off-campus)
Once you have all of your software installed, you will need to make sure you can access the VPN if you are off campus.   
1. Follow these steps to install/connect to VPN on a mac:

## Accessing HPC class
### Step 1: ssh to Nova for the first time
If you are on Putty, put the information as in the picture here:

Replace `hhvu` with your own NetID.

If you are on MACS Terminal, do this:
```
ssh your-net-id@nova.its.iastate.edu
```

For example: `ssh hhvu@nova.its.iastate.edu` (replace `hhvu` with your own NetID).

If this is the first time you log onto Nova, it will respond with "host key not found, generate hostkey?(yes/no)". Answer yes.

At the first attempt to login a GA account will be created for you, and the email with the instructions will be sent to `<your-NetID>@iastate.edu`.

### Step 2: follow the instruction as in the email from HPC class

### Step 3:
After installing and initializing GA as described in the instructions, login to the Nova cluster by repeating Step 1. Enter the 6-digit code generated by GA app when prompted for Verification Code and your ISU password when prompted for password:

Type the GA code from the app on your device when "Verification code:" is prompted.

Then put in your Net ID password. Note that no characters will show in the terminal while you are typing your password.

Next, we have to request a Class partition. Please copy paste the following command to your terminal:
```
salloc -p class-long -N 1 -n 4 -t 3:00:00 -A s2023.gen.349.1
```

Once the partition is granted, it will prompt some messages similar to the following:
